# LAB TECH

This project is built using React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS (Sass). 

## The problem to solve

A biotech laboratory has been keeping track of their sample batch status using a whiteboard and an excel spreadsheet. The goal is to allow automatic timing of batches when they are run on the matchine. When the batches are done, they will show up on a task queue ready to do the next step.

## The solution

Create a sample batch tracking kanban board built using React. Each batch will be its own component with visible status and a count down.
